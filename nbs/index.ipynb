This project serves as an investigative stage, focusing on identifying effective methods to debug and track the state and interactions within these frameworks.\n",

    "## Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the strategies currently under exploration, each offering a unique angle to approach debugging within the Jupyter ecosystem and Reacton/Solara components.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comm\n",
    "\n",
    "- Description: The Comm API, part of the Jupyter notebook's infrastructure, facilitates communication between the front-end and back-end by sending JSON-able blobs. This API is used by widgets for maintaining state synchronization.\n",
    "- Approach: By monkey-patching the `comm.create_comm` function, we can intercept and log all messages exchanged between widgets. This allows the Debugbar to track and modify states dynamically, providing a tool-agnostic method for debugging that doesn't rely directly on the internal state management of Reacton.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reacton\n",
    "\n",
    "- Description: Reacton's `RenderContext` object plays a crucial role in state management, especially with its [`state_get`](https://github.com/widgetti/reacton/blob/3eee8f7681d5aad8d56c284f0c76fb7e55f8d917/reacton/core.py#L1195) method, which is pivotal during state restoration post-hot reloads ([1](https://github.com/widgetti/solara/blob/0099274e25116860e690f32074ffa4136c7edfd6/solara/server/app.py#L239), [2](https://github.com/widgetti/solara/blob/0099274e25116860e690f32074ffa4136c7edfd6/solara/server/app.py#L291)).\n",
    "- Approach:\n",
    "  - State Tracking: Implementing tracking for the `state_get` call within `RenderContext` offers insight into state restoration processes.\n",
    "  - Pre-Render Event: Introducing a pre_render event in Reacton could allow for `state_get` invocations before each rendering phase, enhancing visibility into state changes.\n",
    "  - Integration with Chrome Tracing: Exploring the potential of Reacton's tracer, previously developed by the Widgetti team, to generate trace data compatible with `chrome://tracing` for a detailed analysis of rendering and state management performance.\n"
